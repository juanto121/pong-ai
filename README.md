Review of Reinforcement Learning with policy gradients as shown by A. Karpathy [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)

Minor modifications to the original algorithm.
 - Changed the input preprocessing step to crop more pixels reducing the input size by 18%
 - Changed the learning rate to 1e-3
